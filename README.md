# cis-451
My final project for cis 451 at University of Oregon

~~Website currently hosted at https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~bkieser/cis451/project/~~

But sometimes the server stops and I have to restart it manually, so don't expect it to be up. Mostly just saved it here so I don't potentially lose it if I can't access my student page anymore.

UPDATE: As of October 30, 2020 I will lose access to my University's Computer Science account, which means I'll no longer have a MySQL server to display the page. I've taken screenshots of the page with examples of what some of the searches might look like for posterity. It's not much to look at, but I wanted to keep it as a record anyways.
